# TABA Project – PCA and ANOVA on Food Datasets

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Two-Way ANOVA to explore nutritional data and flavor perception based on cooking methods and sauces. It was developed as part of the Statistics II Terminal Assignment Based Assessment (TABA) for a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.

## Project Breakdown

### Part 1: PCA on Nutritional Profiles
- Dataset: USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (2017–2018)
- Goal: Identify nutritional patterns in food using PCA
- Tools: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn

### Part 2: Two-Way ANOVA on Flavour Intensity
- Dataset: Custom-created from Food.com recipes
- Goal: Test the effect of cooking method and sauce type on simulated flavour scores
- Tools: pandas, numpy, seaborn, scipy.stats
